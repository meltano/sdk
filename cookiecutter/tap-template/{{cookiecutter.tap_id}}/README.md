```

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

<!--
Developer TODO: If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
-->

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `{{ cookiecutter.library_name }}/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `{{cookiecutter.tap_id}}` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run {{cookiecutter.tap_id}} --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd {{ cookiecutter.tap_id }}
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke {{ cookiecutter.tap_id }} --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt {{ cookiecutter.tap_id }} target-jsonl
```
