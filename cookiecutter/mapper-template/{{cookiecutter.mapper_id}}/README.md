```
-->

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
mapper is available by running:

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer mapper will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization

<!--
Developer TODO: If your mapper requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
-->

  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `{{cookiecutter.mapper_id}}` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This mapper will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd {{ cookiecutter.mapper_id }}
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Run a test `run` pipeline:
meltano run tap-smoke-test {{ cookiecutter.mapper_id }} target-jsonl
```
