# SDK Dev Guide

## Overview

Create taps with `singer-sdk` requires overriding just two or three classes:

1. The `Tap` class. This class governs configuration, validation,
   and stream discovery.
2. The stream class. You have different options for your base class depending on the type
   of data source you are working with:
    - `Stream` - The **generic** base class for streams.
    - `RESTStream` - The base class for **REST**-type streams.
    - `GraphQLStream` - The base class for **GraphQL**-type streams. This class inherits
      from `RESTStream`, since GraphQL is built upon REST.
3. An optional authenticator class. You can omit this class entirely if you do not require authentication or if you prefer to write custom authentication logic. The supported authenticator classes are:
    - `SimpleAuthenticator` - This class is functionally equivalent to overriding
      `http_headers` property in the stream class.
    - `OAuthAuthenticator` - This class performs an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
    - `OAuthJWTAuthenticator` - This class performs an JWT (Java Web Token) authentication
       flow.

### Detailed Class Reference

### SDK Implementation Details

[SDK Implementation Details](./implementation/README.md) section.

## Building a New Tap

The best way to get started is by building a new project from the
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io)
[tap template](https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk/-/tree/main/cookiecutter/tap-template).

To use the cookiecutter template:

```bash
# Install pipx if you haven't already
pip3 install pipx
pipx ensurepath
# Restart your terminal here, if needed, to get the updated PATH
pipx install cookiecutter
```

Initialize Cookiecutter template:

```bash
cookiecutter https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk --directory="cookiecutter/tap-template"
```

Once you've answered the cookiecutter prompts, follow the instructions in the
generated `README.md` file to complete your new tap. You can also reference the
[Meltano Tutorial](https://meltano.com/tutorials/create-a-custom-extractor.html) for a more
detailed guide.
