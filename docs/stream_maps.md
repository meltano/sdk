# Inline Stream Maps

## Introduction

SDK-based taps, targets, and mappers automatically support the custom inline mappings feature. Stream mappings can be applied to solve the following real-world applications:

### Stream-Level Mapping Applications

- **Stream aliasing:** streams can be aliased to provide custom naming downstream.
- **Stream filtering:** streams records can be filtered based on any user-defined logic.
- **Stream duplication:** streams can be split or duplicated and then sent as multiple distinct
  streams to the downstream target.

### Property-Level Mapping Applications

- **Property-level aliasing:** properties can be renamed in the resulting stream.
- **Property-level transformations:** properties can be transformed inline.
- **Property-level exclusions:** properties can be removed from the resulting stream.
- **Property-level additions:** new properties can be created based on inline user-defined
  expressions.

### Schema Flattening Applications

- ***Flatten nested properties:** separates large complex properties into multiple distinct fields.

For instance, a complex `user` property may look like this:

```js
{
    // ...
    "user": {
        "first_name": "Jane",
        "last_name": "Carter",
        "id": "jcarter"
    }
}
```

Rather than receive the entire record as one large structure, flattening the record would output
three distinct fields:

- `user__first_name`
- `user__last_name`
- `user__id`

## Out-of-scope capabilities

These capabilities are all out of scope _by design_:

- **Mappers do not support aggregation.**
  - To aggregate data, first land the data and then apply aggregations using a
    transformation tool like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com).
- **Mappers do not support joins between streams.**
  - To join data, first land the data and then perform joins using a
    transformation tool like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com).
- **Mappers do not support external API lookups.**
  - To add external API lookups, you can either (a) land all your data and then joins using
    a transformation tool like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com), or (b) create a custom mapper
    plugin with inline lookup logic.

### A feature for all Singer users, enabled by the SDK

The mapping features described here are create for the **_users_** of SDK-based taps and targets.

Developers simply enable the feature using the instructions below, and then users can benefit from having inline transformation capabilities out-of-box on their favorite taps and targets.

**Note:** to support non-SDK taps and targets, we are also creating a standalone inline mapper plugin (`meltano-map-transform`), which follows all specifications defined here and can apply mapping transformations between _any_ Singer tap and target, even if they are not built using the SDK.

## Enabling Stream Maps in SDK-Based Plugins

To support inline mapping functions, the developer only needs to declare two plugin settings,
called `stream_maps` and `stream_map_settings`, and declare both settings as `object` type. (For example:
`Property("stream_maps, ObjectType())` if using the python helper classes or
`"stream_maps": {"type": "object"}` if using native JSON Schema declarations.)

If the `stream_maps` setting is detected, the following behaviors will be implemented
by the SDK automatically:

1. For taps, the SCHEMA and RECORD messages will automatically be transformed,
   duplicated, filtered, or aliased, as per the `stream_maps` config settings _after_
   all other tap-specific logic is executed.
   - Because this process happens automatically after all other tap logic is executed, the
     tap developer does not have to write any custom handling logic.
   - The tap development process is fully insulated from this 'out-of-box' functionality.
2. Similarly for targets, the received streams are processed by the `stream_maps` config
   setting _prior_ to any Sink processing functions.
   - This means that the target developer can assume that all streams and records are
     transformed, aliased, filtered, etc. _before_ any custom target code is executed.
3. The upcoming standalone mapper plugin (`meltano-map-transform`) is a hybrid tap/target which
   simply receives input from a tap, transforms all stream and schema messages via the
   `stream_maps` config option, and then emits the resulting stream(s) to a downstream
   target.
   - A standalone mapper is not needed in cases where either the tap or target is built
     on the SDK (since either could accept the `stream_maps` config option) but it is useful
     in cases where using legacy taps or targets which do not yet support this
     functionality - or in cases where you want to run a one-time sync with special logic
     and otherwise keep tap and target config untouched.

## Constructing the `stream_maps` config object

The `stream_maps` config expects a mapping of stream names to a structured transform object.

Here is a sample `stream_maps` transformation which removes all references to `email` and
adds `email_domain` and `email_hash` as new properties:

`config.json`:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": { // Apply these transforms to the stream called 'customers'
            "email": null, // drop the PII field from RECORD and SCHEMA messages
            "email_domain": "owner_email.split('@')[-1]", // capture just the email domain
            "email_hash": "md5(config['hash_seed'] + owner_email)", // for uniqueness checks
        }
    },
    "stream_map_config": {
        // hash outputs are not able to be replicated without the original seed:
        "hash_seed": "01AWZh7A6DzGm6iJZZ2T"
    }
}
```

If map expressions should have access to special config, such as in the
one-way hash algorithm above, define those config arguments within the optional
`stream_map_config` setting. Values defined in `stream_map_config` will be available
to expressions using the `config` dictionary.

### Constructing Expressions

Expressions are defined and parsed using the
[`simpleval`](https://github.com/danthedeckie/simpleeval) expression library. This library
accepts most native python expressions and is extended by custom functions which have been declared
within the SDK.

### Accessing Stream Properties within Mapping Expressions

By default, all stream properties are made available via the property's given name. For
instance, assuming a field called `customer_id` in the stream, you can write
`customer_id.lower()` to apply Python's `lower()` function to all customer IDs.

Note: In some cases, property names may collide with built-in functions or keywords. To
handle these cases, use the `record` name as described below (or its shorthand `_`).

These are all equivalent means of transforming the `customer_id` property of the current
record:

- `customer_id.lower()`
- `record['customer_id'].lower()`
- `_['customer_id'].lower()`

### Other Built-in Functions and Names

Currently, there are a small handful of convenience functions and object aliases, which
can be referenced directly by mapping expressions.

#### Built-In Functions

- `md5()` - returns an inline MD5 hash of any string, outputting the string representation
    of the hash's hex digest.
  - This is defined by the SDK internally with native python:
    `hashlib.md5(<input>.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()`.

#### Built-in Variable Names

- `config` - a dictionary with the `stream_map_config` values from settings. This can be used
  to provide a secret hash seed, for instance.
- `record` - an alias for the record values dictionary in the current stream.
- `_` - same as `record` but shorter to type
- `self` - the existing property value if the property already exists

#### Automatic Schema Detection

For performance reasons, type detection is performed at runtime using text analysis
of the provided expressions. Type detection is performed once per stream, prior to
records being generated.

The following logic is applied in determining the SCHEMA of the transformed stream:

1. Calculations which begin with the text `str(`, `float(`, `int(` will be
   assumed to be belonging to the specified type.
2. Otherwise, if the property already existed in the original stream, it will be assumed
   to have the same data type as the original stream.
3. Otherwise, if no type is detected using the above rules, any new stream properties will
   be assumed to be of type `str` .

## Customized `stream_map` Behaviors

### Removing a single stream or property

To remove a stream, declare the stream within `stream_maps` config and assign it the value
`null`. For example:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "addresses": null  // don't sync the stream called 'addresses'
    },
}
```

To remove a property, declare the property within the designated stream's map entry and
assign it the value `null`. For example:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {
            "email": null, // don't sync the 'email' stream property
        }
    },
}
```

### Remove all undeclared streams or properties

By default, all streams and stream properties will be included in the output unless
specifically excluded. However, you can reverse this behavior using the `"__else__": null`
instruction to only include defined properties or streams.

**Note:** the primary key properties of the stream will still be included by default, to ensure proper deduping and
record identification at the target. To also remove primary keys from the stream, see the `__key_properties__` override
below.

To remove all streams except the `customers` stream:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {},
        "__else__": null
    },
}
```

To remove all fields from the `customers` stream except `customer_id`:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {
            "customer_id": "customer_id",
            "__else__": null
        },
    },
}
```

### Unset or modify the stream's primary key behavior

To override the stream's default primary key properties, add the `__key_properties__` operation within the stream map definition.

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {
            "customer_id": null,                          // Remove the original Customer ID column
            "customer_id_hashed": "md5(customer_id)",     // Add a new (and still unique) ID column
            "__key_properties__": ["customer_id_hashed"]  // Updated key to reflect the new name
        },
    },
}
```

Notes:

- To sync the stream as if it did not contain a primary key, simply set `__key_properties__` to `null`.
- Key properties _must_ be present in the transformed stream result. Otherwise, an error will be raised.

#### Q: What is the difference between `primary_keys` and `key_properties`?

**A:** These two are _generally_ identical - and will only differ in cases like the above where `key_properties` is manually
overridden or nullified by the user of the tap. Developers will specify `primary_keys` for each stream in the tap,
but they do not control if the user will override `key_properties` behavior when initializing the stream. Primary keys
describe the nature of the upstream data as known by the source system. However, either through manual catalog manipulation and/or by
setting stream map transformations, the in-flight dedupe keys (`key_properties`) may be overridden or nullified by the user at any time.

Additionally, some targets do not support primary key distinctions, and there are valid use cases to intentionally unset
the `key_properties` in an extract-load pipeline. For instance, it is common to intentionally nullify key properties to trigger
"append-only" loading behavior in certain targets, as may be required for historical reporting. This does not change the
underlying nature of the `primary_key` configuration in the upstream source data, only how it will be landed or deduped
in the downstream source.

## Aliasing a stream using `__alias__`

To alias a stream, simply add the operation `"__alias__": "new_name"` to the stream
definition. For example, to alias the `customers` stream as `customer_v2`, use the
following:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {
            "__alias__": "customers_v2"
        },
    },
}
```

## Duplicating or splitting a stream using `__source__`

To create a new stream as a copy of the original, specify the operation
`"__source__": "stream_name"`. For example, you can create a copy of the `customers` stream
which only contains PII properties using the following:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {
            // exclude these since we're capturing them in the pii stream
            "email": null,
            "full_name": null
        },
        "customers_pii": {
            "__source__": "customers",
            // include just the PII and the customer_id
            "customer_id": "customer_id",
            "email": "email",
            "full_name": "full_name",
            // exclude anything not declared
            "__else__": null,
        },
    },
}
```

## Filtering out records from a stream using `__filter__` operation

The `__filter__` operation accept a string expression which must evaluate to `true` or
`false`. Filter expressions should be wrapped in `bool()` to ensure proper type conversion.

For example, to only include customers with emails from the `example.com` company domain:

```js
{
    "stream_maps": {
        "customers": {
            "__filter__": "email.endswith('@example.com')"
        }
    },
}
```

### Understanding Filters' Affects on Parent-Child Streams

Nested child streams iterations will be skipped if their parent stream has a record-level
filter applied. This applies only to the primary map for a stream, ignoring any filter
logic on duplicate streams created using `__source__`.

If you want to prevent child streams from being filtered, create a duplicate stream using
`__source__` and filter the duplicated stream instead of the original. Then, if you do not
want to emit two streams, suppress the original by assigning its map the value `null`.
Since the primary (same-named) version of the stream is not filtered, this will force
iteration through the entire source stream and its children, while only
emitting those parent records that qualify the filter expression.

**Note:** aliasing a stream with the `__alias__` operation does not impact child stream selection logic.

## Known Limitations

_The below functionality may be expanded or improved in the future. Please send us an
Issue or MR if you are interested in contributing to these features._

### No nested property declarations or removals

Only first-level properties may be added, removed, or transformed. This means, for example, that you can
add or remove a top-level field called `customer_email`, but you cannot add or remove a
nested `email` property if embedded in a `customer` json object.

### Schema detection capabilities are limited

Schema detection currently relies on somewhat naive static text parsing. The workaround for
the user is fairly trivial - which is to send hints by wrapping the entire expression in
`str()`, `float()`, `int()`, etc. While this is perhaps not optimal, it meets our core
requirement for static type evaluation with minimal config complexity.

### Security Implications for Low-Trust Environments

While `simpleeval` does provide some isolation and sandboxing capabilities built-in, there
are always security implications when allowing user-provided code to run on managed servers.
For this reason, administrators should not permit arbitrary setting injection
from untrusted users. As a rule, tap and target settings should never be permitted to be modified
by untrusted users.

### Else behavior currently limited to `null` assignment

The only operation currently allowed for the `__else__` instruction is `null`, meaning
to exclude any streams or properties not otherwise defined. In the future, we may add
additional options or advanced logic. For instance, we could in the future add the ability
to remove or treat a property from any stream in which it appears. We could also hash
any properties not otherwise declared in the map (for PII reasons and to enable advanced
testing scenarios).

## Q&A

### Q: How do stream map operations interact with stream selection via the Singer catalog metadata?

**Answer:** Stream maps are applied only _after_ stream selection rules are applied. This means that if a stream or property is not selected, it will not be available for stream map operations. Stream maps are not intended to be a replacement for catalog-based selection, but they may be used to further refine streams beyond the original selection parameters.

### Q: If streams are excluded by applying mapping rules, does the tap automatically skip them?

**Answer:** It depends. For SDK-based taps, yes. If an entire stream is specified to be
excluded at the tap level, then the stream will be skipped exactly as if it were deselected
in the catalog metadata.

If a stream is specified to be excluded at the target level, or in a standalone mapper
between the tap and target, the filtering occurs downstream from the tap and therefor cannot
affect the selection rules of the tap itself. Except in special test cases or in cases where
runtime is trivial, we highly recommend implementing stream-level exclusions at the tap
level rather than within the downstream target or mapper plugins.

### Q: Why use a separate `stream_map_config` option instead of granting access to all `config` values?

**Answer:** The base-level config is also the primary mechanism for submitting auth secrets
to the plugin. If we provided direct access to all config options, it would drastically
increase the security risks associated with code injection and accidental or malicious
leakage of credentials to downstream logs. By limiting to only those config values intended
for use by the mapper, we significantly improve the security profile of the feature.
Additionally, plugins are generally expected to fail if they receive unexpected config
arguments. The intended use cases for stream map config values are user-defined in nature
(such as the hashing use case defined above), and are unlikely to overlap with the
plugin's already-existing settings.
