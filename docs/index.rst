Meltano SDK for Taps and Targets
=======================================

The Meltano_ SDK for Taps and Targets is the fastest way to build custom
data extractors and loaders! Taps and targets built on the SDK are automatically compliant with the
`Singer Spec`_, the de-facto open source standard for extract and load pipelines.

Future-proof extractors and loaders, with less code
---------------------------------------------------

On average, developers tell us that they write about 70% less code by using the SDK, which makes
learning the SDK a great investment. Furthermore, as new features and capabilities are added
to the SDK, your taps and targets can always take advantage of the latest capabilities and
bug fixes, simply by updating your SDK dependency to the latest version.

Built by Meltano and the Singer Community
-----------------------------------------

The SDK is built with love by the Meltano_ core
team and contributors, with contributions from developers across the Singer_
open source community. SDK-based plugins can easily be `integrated with Meltano`_,
but they can also be used in any data pipeline tool that supports the
`Singer Spec`_.

The SDK project is 100% open source, licensed under the `Apache 2.0`_
permissive license. Please visit our code repo `here in Gitlab`_, where you can
read the `source code`_, `log an issue or feature request`_, and `contribute back`_
to the SDK. We also regularly discuss SDK topics in our `Meltano Slack`_ community,
within the `#singer-tap-development`_ and `#singer-target-development`_ Slack channels.
