# [SDK Implementation Details](./README.md) - Catalog Discovery

All taps developed using the SDK will automatically support `discovery` as a base
capability, which is the process of generating and emitting a catalog that describes the
available streams and stream types.

The catalog generated is automatically populated by a small number of developer inputs. Most
importantly:

- `Tap.discover_streams()` - Should return a list of available "discovered" streams.
- `Stream.schema` or `Stream.schema_filepath` - The JSON Schema definition of each stream,
provided either directly as a Python `dict` or indirectly as a `.json` filepath.
- `Stream.primary_keys` - a list of strings indicating the primary key(s) of the stream.
- `Stream.replication_key` - a single string indicating the name of the stream's replication
key (if applicable).
