      "description": ">>>\nPodcast: Constant Variables\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1322260749\n\nShow Notes: Constant Variables takes a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to build and grow digital products. Focused on helping non-technical people become more comfortable with the nerdy jargon related to mobile software development, we break down technical topics to make them less complex and more accessible, because as Steve Jobs said, \u201cEverything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.\u201d\n\nFrom project managers charged with managing a digital project, to app-based startups looking to scale, to organizations tackling digital transformation initiatives, we share our insights and regularly interview individuals who have \"been there, done that\" to leverage their expertise and learn from their mistakes.\nRecording information:\n\nThey will send a link a few days before the recording.\n\nHost: Tim Bornholdt, tim@jedmahonisgroup.com\n>>>\n\nPoints:\n\n```\nTell us your journey into founding an open source platform for DataOps.\nLet\u2019s break down the terms \u201copen source\u201d and \u201cDataOps\u201d and how they relate to each other.\nWhy is open-source data integration exploding? How is this different from closed-source data integration?\nWe\u2019ve talked a lot about DataOps. To make this more relatable to people who don\u2019t work with data every day, can you give an example of a DataOps team and its role within an organization?\nHow does one go about finding open source repositories?\nIf your best friend came to you looking to learn more about everything we\u2019ve been talking about today, where would you direct them? (Think podcasts, newsletters, people to follow)\nWhere can people learn more about you and the work you\u2019re doing at Meltano?\n```\n\nInstructions:\n\n>>>\n\n1) Please make sure your phone and laptop are in Do Not Disturb mode, and that you are in a quiet room with as little noise as possible (including air conditioning/heater, your laptop fans, and noisy neighbors).\n\n2) You\u2019ll need access to a computer (not a mobile phone) with Google Chrome or Firefox and a pair of headphones. If you have an external microphone, make sure that\u2019s plugged in as well.\n\n3) We use Zencastr to record our episodes. When you\u2019re ready to get going, head to this link: https://zencastr.com/timbornholdt/douwe-mann\n\n4) This is not a live interview, so feel free to start and stop as much as you\u2019d like. Also, if you think of something you\u2019d like to cut after the interview is over, just let me know and I\u2019ll make sure we take it out.\n\n5) Once the interview is over, please keep the webpage open until it says your files have finished uploading.\n\n6) When the episode airs, we\u2019ll send over a link to the show. Feel free to share it on your social platforms!\n\nIf you have any connection issues day of, you can email Tim (tim@jedmahonisgroup.com) or call him (612-462-0891). \n>>>\n\n\n\n## Getting the most out of every episode/ process:\nOnce booked the following checklist needs to happen...\n- [x] send cal invite for podcast and add Emily and Amanda to the invite so we know when recording is happening and we can plan social \n- [ ] communicate to marketing launch date and when we will get video. transcript (add cal invite whenever possible)\n- [ ] possible strategy call before recording to discuss key positioning, points, and CTA\n\n#### on podcast\n- [ ] push CTA and key points\n- [ ] if it is a potential investor sourcing opportunity... \"Mention in the interview we are preparing to raise a round of funding and describe out ideal investor relationship and how much money you need.\"\n- [ ] thanks the host and let them know we will be promoting the episode and ask if there is anything else we can do to help\n- [ ] ask when it will go live\n- [ ] if there is a connection say you would like to stay in touch if possible (needs to be followed up with a personal email a couple of days later)\n\n#### for marketing post podcast\n- [ ] schedule and craft social plans (must tag host and podcast name in posts)\n- [ ] Collect video snippets and any relevant artwork \n- [ ] collect key quotes for promotion\n- [ ] craft plan for continued promotion and content creation opportunities\n   - [ ] repurpose video/ audio\n   - [ ] transcribe text\n   - [ ] create blog posts/ newsletter from content \n   - [ ] create PR pitch for future",

      "description": "### Activity \nWe agreed podcasting is going well and the agency is doing a good job. Therefore we would like to renew with them. I have contacted them letting them know we want to continue. \n\nI also suggested we also add @tayloramurphy to the rotation and split the time between @DouweM and Taylor. This will likely get us a good balance of Meltano product, high-level data discussions, and exec presence pieces. It will also put less of a burden on one person. Lastly, now that our PR agency is onboarded I expect to see some more interviews come through them and we should hopefully get some other event speaking ops this year. All that being said I don't want to over-commit one person to just podcasting. \n\nMy suggestion is we move forward with a 4 podcast a month plan and split them evenly 2 and 2 for the renewal quarter. \n\nI need to confirm @tayloramurphy are you up for up to 2 podcasts a month for the next quarter? The commitment is usually just an hour to 1.5-hour recording and finding a time for the recording. The one other piece would be to get you an exec speaking profile which is pretty much a fancier speaker bio. I wanted to get this done for you regardless. \n\nAnd @DouweM please confirm this plan works for your vision as well. \n\n### Background\nrelated to- https://gitlab.com/meltano/marketing/marketing-general/-/issues/56\n\n### Todos\n\n- [ ] decide on cadence\n\n\n<!-- Labels to add for triaging -->\n~\"valuestream::Business Operation\" \n~\"kind::Non-Product\"",

      "description": ">>>\nI'm looking forward to you joining [Hashmap on Tap](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhashmapinc.com%2Fhashmapontap&sa=D&ust=1634143240054000&usg=AOvVaw36-_X0x0Pbij08l5Y_EEvv)!\n\nHere are the details for the show:\n\nLink to Squadcast is here: https://sqdc.st/studio/f5Hs\n\nHashmap on Tap selected beverage: Douwe's choice: Wit beer from Hoegaarden: https://untappd.com/b/brouwerij-hoegaarden-hoegaarden-wit-blanche/6422\n\nShow Notes and Questions are here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPyMQ000z7UGKDbX31AoBs02Ai1tH469EUcAENMoRlk/edit\n\nPlease feel free to comment/edit this to your liking. We can add, modify, or remove anything you see there, so just update as needed.\n\nI grabbed some introduction information about you from Linkedin, but I'd be glad to modify this however you like for the actual show.\n\nThe questions in the show notes should not be thought of as a list of interview questions, but more like conversation starters. I'm interested in having a natural dialogue and seeing where it takes us. \n\n**On the day of recording, here are a few things to know:**\n- You'll need headphones, a webcam, and a quiet room for about an hour. \n- The recording quality is best if you can use headphones for audio during our sessions. Audio through speakers often gets picked up by our guests' mics and it can be difficult to edit.\n- We record using SquadCast, an online recording tool. It will also serve as our video conference tool for this session (we won't be producing a video though - just the audio podcast). Please join SquadCast when you're ready to get started. I won't start recording until we're both on the call and ready to begin.\n- Previous guests have mentioned that SquadCast doesn't work great with Safari, but Chrome and Brave both seem to work well.\n- Please make sure to have your drink ready for the episode.\n\n**To join our session**, simply open the squadcast link above in a desktop browser. This link will work between now and our recording session, so feel free to jump in to get the lay of the land ahead of time. It's pretty simple, so don't feel that you need to prep or anything.\n\n**Our agenda will be as follows:**\n- We will join the Squadcast call\n- We will do a final review of the show outline and ensure everyone is comfortable with the content of the session before any recording starts.\n- Recording begins\n- After the recording, Hashmap Marketing will edit the raw recordings to create a final episode. Any special editing requests from the recording session can be accommodated here.\n- You will be sent a copy of the edited episode for approval before publishing\n- If all is well and you approve, Hashmap will then publish the episode. Otherwise, Hashmap Marketing will make any requested editing changes and provide you with a promotional URL link as well.\n>>>\n\nHost: Kelly Kohlleffel, 713-628-6030, kelly@hashmapinc.com\n\n## Getting the most out of every episode/ process:\nOnce booked the following checklist needs to happen...\n- [x] send cal invite for podcast and add Emily and Amanda to the invite so we know when recording is happening and we can plan social \n- [ ] communicate to marketing launch date and when we will get video. transcript (add cal invite whenever possible)\n- [ ] possible strategy call before recording to discuss key positioning, points, and CTA\n\n#### on podcast\n- [x] push CTA and key points\n- [ ] if it is a potential investor sourcing opportunity... \"Mention in the interview we are preparing to raise a round of funding and describe out ideal investor relationship and how much money you need.\"\n- [x] thanks the host and let them know we will be promoting the episode and ask if there is anything else we can do to help\n- [x] ask when it will go live\n- [ ] if there is a connection say you would like to stay in touch if possible (needs to be followed up with a personal email a couple of days later)\n\n#### for marketing post podcast\n- [ ] schedule and craft social plans (must tag host and podcast name in posts)\n- [ ] Collect video snippets and any relevant artwork \n- [ ] collect key quotes for promotion\n- [ ] craft plan for continued promotion and content creation opportunities\n   - [ ] repurpose video/ audio\n   - [ ] transcribe text\n   - [ ] create blog posts/ newsletter from content \n   - [ ] create PR pitch for future",

They seemed super professional and efficient. If we onboarded Aug 1 podcast would likely be released a month later. What timing might work for you and what other info do you need to commit? \n\n### Reach\n* $395 per interview\n* expected reach per podcast- if we start with a low estimate that each podcast has a listenership of 1000 people that comes out to $2.5 per listen for us.
