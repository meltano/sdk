      "description": "I'm resurrecting https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2634 a bit from the dead. As we build out the DataOps OS I think it'll become more important to have a native abstraction around the data warehouse / storage piece.\n\nIn the context of _loaders_ though, I'm not sure what this looks like. An initial iteration brings to mind https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3108 which would allow for defining the info around a source, but it's not clear what work is being done.\n\nPerhaps by trying to bring in an open source warehouse like Clickhouse to Meltano we could suss out some of these relevant abstractions. I think this will be important for implementing many of the DataOps features as `environments` implies a stronger connection to the storage layer.\n\n@aaronsteers @kgpayne @pandemicsyn @edgarrmondragon @pnadolny13 @DouweM would love any thoughts you have.",

      "description": "Currently all Python-specific plugin handlers live in our main `Meltano` repo and is installed in a single go.\n\nTo make a leaner install, we could (for instance) refactor \"Singer EL\", \"dbt Transform\", and \"Airflow Orchestrator\" into separate repositories.\n\nFor each type of plugin we want to support, we'd have to create an interface layer and decide which hooks/notifications/invocations are needed by the respective type of plugin.\n\nNote: The refactoring effort for the Singer EL would likely be very large. It might make more sense to use orchestrators (Dagster or Airflow) first.\n\n## How is this different?\n\nToday, if we want to support Dagster in the same way we support Airflow, we have three levers we can control:\n\n1. CLI-based 'command' definitions. This is basically just aliasing existing CLI commands from the tool. Not capable of deep integrations.\n2. Files-based plugins. This is the least robust: we download some pre-configured files into the repo.\n3. Python code-based approach. This is the only \"deep\" integration option we have today. This gives a lot of power to wrap the tool's capabilities, but it also requires expanding the code base of `Meltano` core repo.\n\nThis proposal would give an alternate path to the third option, enabling us to write an external plugin definition in python, and import it into the project without having it defined tightly as part of that repo.",

      "description": "### Problem to solve\nRight now there is a fair amount of code that needs to be written and maintained for Meltano to be properly integrated with a workflow orchestrator. In order to make it easier to adopt Meltano it would be useful for it to have a web API that is documented and maintained to enable external systems to use that to drive the execution of Meltano pipelines. As part of that API it would be beneficial to expose metadata of the taps/targets, schema, timing, lineage, etc.\n\n### Target audience\n(For whom are we doing this? Include a persona)\nThe audience for this feature includes software developers who want a straightforward way of adding data integration to their systems, data engineers who want to include Meltano as part of their data platform without requiring deep customization or long lead times to build an integration, and analytics engineers who want to use Meltano without adopting it as their entire interface.\n\n### Proposal\nGiven that there is already a web application for Meltano it would probably be easiest to add the APIs to that code. Alternatively, it might be useful to build a separate API application using something like FastAPI to get out of the box support for Swagger, and simplify the work of integrating with the Meltano Python APIs.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nA successful implementation would provide a set of well designed and documented APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, whatever) that provide access to functionality in Meltano that will drive pipeline execution, allow for querying the state of execution runs (current and past), retrieve pipeline details (sources/destinations, configuration, etc.), and metadata about run results for integrating with data platforms (e.g. data catalogs, lineage systems, orchestrators, etc.)\n\n### Links / references\n- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\n- [OpenLineage](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage)",

Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)**\n\nAs we continue to build Meltano, we can\u2019t be reliant on our own execution of features that already exist in the market. Our goal is to be the glue, and we aren\u2019t significantly differentiated on analysis as a feature. It would be too expensive and take too long for us to develop this feature on our own, so we need to integrate a 3rd party solution.\n\n**2. For whom do we solve that problem? (target market)**\n\nFor users:\n* Who want to write their own queries\n* Who want to build graphs and charts\n\nFor ourselves:\n* We don\u2019t need to build and maintain all these features\n* We wouldn\u2019t have to build an analysis tool from the ground up\n* We wouldn\u2019t have to create a large team to maintain and improve it\n* We get all the features of Metabase\n* We get to leverage Metabase documentation\n\n**3. How big is the opportunity? (market size)**\n\nMost Meltano users, whether on the command line or in the UI, will eventually want to produce analysis and dashboards\n\n**4. What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)**\n\nOur current Analyze experience, which is limited but works\n\nExporting the data that Meltano has extracted, loaded, and transformed into a third party analysis solution (Periscope, Tableau, Looker, Mode, etc.)\n\nThe risk is that if users start to rely on some other product for Analysis, they will eventually not need Meltano ELT (there is a lot of consolidation going on right now, and many dashboarding companies are moving up the stack) and won't benefit from the end-to-end pipeline management solution we are offering.\n\n**5. Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator)**\n\nWe understand the integration points of Meltano \n\n**6. Why now? (market window)**\n\nIn order to get users to adopt Meltano and come back, they need to create dashboards that they want to keep leveraging over time. They need to feel like these dashboards provide crucial insights into business metrics and power business processes in their companies\n\n**7. How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy)**\n\nEmail existing users, blog posts, social media, case studies.\n\n* [ ] @kressaty can you please add more info here? \n\n**8. How will we measure success/make money from this product? (metrics/revenue strategy)**\n\nIncreased MAUI\n\n**9. What factors are critical to success?
